# Bias in Markovian multistate models under violation of the Markov assumption

Christian Dudel, dudel@demogr.mpg.de

This repository contains R code for simulations assessing the bias of several statistics 
estimated using Markovian discrete-time multistate models when the Markov assumption 
is violated. This includes simulation scenarios with duration dependence,
unobserved heterogeneity, and combinations of both duration dependence and
unobserved heterogeneity. Running the code requires, among other things,
the package dtms, which is available at https://github.com/christiandudel/dtms.
